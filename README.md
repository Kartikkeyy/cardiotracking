# Heart Disease Classification Project

## 📖 Overview

This project is designed to classify whether a patient has heart disease based on various medical attributes. It uses a machine learning model trained on a dataset containing features such as age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, and more. The project includes a PostgreSQL database for storing data, a Python-based migration system, and a Dockerized environment for easy deployment.
